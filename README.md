Hloo,
Hope you all are well and safe in good health.ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

This is Bus reservation program made using C++.

In this program I have the code in such a way that you can have different options available to choose.

You can create
  1. List of any number of busses you want to have with their details such as
      - Bus number
      - Driver name
      - Arrival time
      - Departure time
      - From location
      - To location
  2. You can Reserve your seats as how you reserve in real life.
  3. You can check 
      - Seats available.
      - Seats booked.
      - Passengers names along with their seat numbers.
  4. You can also check what are the different busses available and their details in this.
  
So, there you go I have given you a short brief of what happens in this program.
If you want to check out more and experience it, please give it a try.

Take care
